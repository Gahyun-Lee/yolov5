The dataset includes 1350 images.
QR-codes are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -45 and +45 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 3.5 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 20 percent of pixels
